    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A <i>logical circuit</i> is a system with a given number of inputs and one output.  When impulses are applied to the inputs of the circuit, it responds by giving either an output (signal 1) or no output (signal 0).  The input impulses are characterized in the same way as the inputs: positive input (signal 1) or no input (signal 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a logical circuit is to be built using only <i>NOR gates</i>.  A NOR gate is a device with two inputs and one output, and which has the property that there is a positive output (signal 1) if and only if neither input is positive.  By connecting such gates in combination, it is possible to construct a circuit to perform any desired logical function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the circuit illustrated in the following figure will respond to the inputs A and B in the way indicated by the truth table.  (Unlabeled inputs are 0.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/N07_images/circuit.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>The objective</strong> is to construct a circuit using the minimum number of NOR gates that will perform the logical function specified by the following truth table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| A | B | Output |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | \n",
    "| 0 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| 0 | 1 | 1 |\n",
    "| 1 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 1 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each output from a NOR gate must lead into exactly one input into another NOR gate.  It may be assumed that the optimal design is a \"subnet\" of the \"maximal\" net shown in the following figure.\n",
