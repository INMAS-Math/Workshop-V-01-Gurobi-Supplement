    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gurobi optimizer is a tool used to solve and analyze optimization problems.  An optimization problem maximizes or minimizes some function or set of functions within some set of feasible options.  This tool is expansive and adaptive: today, Gurobi is used by large organizations such as the NFL, the U.S. Census Bureau, GE, DoorDash, and many others in addition to being the favorite optimizer of academics and smaller professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solver is powerful!  However, it is only as effective as the designers who use it.  It is the humans behind the screen who are responsible for efficiently representing their optimization problems in mathematical terms.  In so doing, we can put this impressive machine to best use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical programs\n",
    "\n",
    "A <strong>mathematical program</strong> is a formulation of an optimization problem in terms of objective functions and constraints.  In standard form, a mathematical program is expressed as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$\\textrm{minimize or maximize the}$ $\\textbf{objective function}$ $f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$\\textrm{subject to the}$ $\\textbf{constraint equations}$ $g_i(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)\\begin{Bmatrix} \\leq \\\\ \\geq \\\\ = \\end{Bmatrix} b_i, \\forall i \\in \\{1,...,m\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables $x_i$ are known as <strong>decision variables</strong>: the values of these variables in the solution will <i>decide</i> how we procede in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <strong>linear programming problem</strong> or <strong>LP problem</strong> is a mathematical program where the objective functions $f()$ and the constraint equations $g_i()$ each are linear.  This type is the most straightforward (as well as the least computationally expensive for our solver).  Let's explore LP problems as we create our first mathematical programming model with Gurobi."

    "\n",
    "Gurobi takes a few steps in advance to reduce the complexity of our problem.  This goes beyond simply reducing the matrix; there are various tricks Gurobi can do to combine several constraints into one or to set variables' values automatically.  For example, look at our $x_3$ variable.  $x_3$ has a positive coefficient in our objective function, and we are minimizing that function.  So, we want $x_3$ to be as small as possible.  Meanwhile, $x_3$ has a negative coefficient in each of the constraint equations, and these are of the type \"greater than or equal to\".  So again, we want $x_3$ as small as possible.  Gurobi presolve then sets $x_3$ to its lower bound of zero right off the bat, effectively removing the variable from consideration.  Techniques like these reduce Gurobi's solving time, often by orders of magnitude in larger models."
